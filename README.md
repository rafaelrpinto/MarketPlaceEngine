## Deprecated

OMDB has changed their API and gone private, so this repo won't be updated for a while...

## Overview

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rafaelrpinto/tv-tracker-api.svg?branch=master)

Node.js api for searching movies and tv series. Currently this API retrieves data from the [Open Movie Database](https://www.omdbapi.com/).

## Running everything with docker-compose

```bash
# Get the code
git clone https://github.com/rafaelrpinto/TvTracker-Backend
cd TvTracker-Backend
docker-compose up
```

Check each microservice README to see how to test it or run it individually.
